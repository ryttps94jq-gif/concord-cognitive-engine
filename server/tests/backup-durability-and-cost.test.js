// Pins three backup defects found 2026-07-28, all of the same family: a backup
// that reported success while doing less than it claimed.
//
// 1. 🔴 THE DATABASE WAS NEVER BACKED UP. `runBackup` gzipped a hardcoded
//    "/data/db/concord.db" — a Docker-shaped path that does not exist on the
//    bare-metal deploy, where the database is at DB_PATH
//    (`process.env.DB_PATH || <DATA_DIR>/concord.db`). `existsSync` returned
//    false on every run, the block was skipped, and the surrounding catch
//    logged at DEBUG and never even fired because nothing threw. The daily
//    backup returned `{ok:true}` while the ledger of record for money, DTUs
//    and auth went uncaptured. Same silently-disarmed shape as the Trivy gate
//    that scanned nothing for months.
//
// 2. Backups were written PRETTY-PRINTED (`JSON.stringify(backup, null, 2)`),
//    inflating every file 1.30x — measured on the real corpus, 8.7MB -> 11.4MB
//    — for indentation nothing reads. These are machine-restored via the
//    `backup.data?.dtus` path, never opened by hand. The main state saver
//    already documents "always use compact JSON to halve string memory"; this
//    path simply never got the same treatment.
//
// 3. Two overlapping backup systems ran on separate clocks. `createBackup`
//    fired every 2h (12x/day, each a synchronous multi-MB stringify +
//    writeFileSync on the main thread) on top of `runBackup`'s daily pass and
//    the debounced snapshot's 5s window. The interval default is now 24h.
//
// The retention assertion is the subtle one and is the reason this file
// exists rather than a comment: the old count was a bare `24`, written against
// the 2h cadence ("~48 hours"). Moving the interval to 24h without touching it
// would have silently turned 24 files into 24 DAYS of retention — a 12x disk
// INCREASE arriving as a side effect of a perf fix. Retention is now derived
// from the interval, and that derivation is pinned here.
//
// Run: node --test server/tests/backup-durability-and-cost.test.js

// Assert against CODE, not comments.
//
// The first version of this file failed on two assertions for a reason worth
// recording: the fix's own explanatory comments quote the removed constructs
// verbatim (`"/data/db/concord.db"` and the pretty-print call) in order to
// explain what was wrong — so a plain substring search found the comment and
// reported the bug as still present. That is the self-inflicted grep
// false-positive CLAUDE.md documents for the UX grader, where a doc comment
// naming a retired component re-triggered the very flag describing it.
//
// The tempting fix is to reword the comments so the literals never appear.
// That is backwards: it degrades the explanation to satisfy a test. Strip
// comments instead, using the repo's own string-aware stripper (it tracks
// quote state, so a "//" inside a string literal is not mistaken for a
// comment) so the prose can stay as precise as it needs to be.
//
// Scoped per-function, NOT whole-file, and that distinction is load-bearing:
// running the stripper over all ~80k lines of server.js leaves this file's
// own comment intact, because somewhere earlier the stripper desyncs (an
// unbalanced quote or backtick puts it into string mode and it stops
// recognising comments). Verified directly — the same comment strips
// correctly in isolation and survives in full-file context. Small,
// self-contained slices keep the stripper honest.
