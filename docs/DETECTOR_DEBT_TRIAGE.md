# Detector debt — triage ledger

Phase-1/2 output of the detector-debt sweep: **enumerate + document
(read-only) → cluster by root cause → fix per cluster**, never per raw
finding. Each entry records what the detector flags, the real shape of the
flagged code, and — critically — **whether the detector's own source comments
already name the pattern as a known false-positive class**. That check exists
because a prior batch burned a whole pass rediscovering, per-finding, that 6
of 7 `money_txn_untransacted_writes` hits were one class the detector already
documented inline.

**Hard rule, unchanged:** `server/lib/detectors/*`, `audit/detectors/BASELINE.json`,
`audit/detectors/BUDGET.json` and `scripts/autoloop/*` are `guard.mjs`-PROTECTed.
A genuine false positive is resolved by a sanctioned per-file/per-call-site
annotation or by a deliberate, reviewed baseline refresh — **never** by
softening a detector.

The current-state section below is the live picture. Everything under
**"Historical record"** is the append-only log of prior worked passes; it is
kept for provenance and should not be read as current counts.

---

# CURRENT STATE — live run 2026-07-25T12:11:32Z

Produced by exactly one invocation of `cd server && node scripts/run-detectors.js`
at HEAD `9ea23642` (branch `claude/game-systems-audit-continuation-cobe3q`).
46 detectors registered, all reported `ok` — no `no_db`, no `detector_threw`.
Wall-clock ≈ 4 min under contention with a concurrently-running test suite.

## 1. Real counts

| severity | count |
|---|---:|
| critical | **0** |
| high | **7** |
| medium | **0** |
| low | **0** |
| info | **53** |
| **total** | **60** |

Two things about this table are worth stating plainly:

- **The medium and low tiers are empty.** That is new. The 18 medium findings
  captured in `BASELINE.json` v1 (generated 2026-07-25T09:33Z) have all been
  closed by the 24 commits that landed between that refresh and this run —
  `stale-code`'s three `_new`/`_old` rebuild-staging tables (exempted in
  `01162d7f`), the `command-injection` autoloop sink (`e4bb055d`/`2c02f284`),
  the three `dead-event-listener` Godot-scope orphans (`60e84066`), the nine
  `unused-destructured-param` findings (`f9cbf528`/`f0a2e16b`), and the
  `frontend-unsafe-chain` `DraftEditor` residual.
- **All 7 highs are the same 7 that the 2026-07-25 authorized baseline refresh
  reviewed and blessed.** Zero net-new highs *by shape*.

  > ⚠️ **Correction (2026-07-25, later the same day): "zero net-new by shape"
  > does NOT imply the ratchet is green, and the original wording here claimed
  > it did.** The ratchet does not compare shapes — it compares

  > `added: 3 (high=2, info=1)` and **fails** with
  > `new_high_or_critical { count: 2 }`, exit 1. The 2 highs are precisely the

  >
  > Keep the distinction sharp when reading any row in this ledger: **"no new

  > false independently, and here the first is true while the second is false.
  > The gate closes only via a human-authorized `BASELINE.json` refresh
  > (`guard.mjs` PROTECTs that file), never by re-reasoning about shape.

**Drift vs `BASELINE.json` v1** (`0 critical / 7 high / 18 medium / 0 low /
53 info` = 78 fingerprints): high unchanged at 7, medium 18 → 0, info
unchanged at 53, total 78 → 60. Note the 6 `money-txn-hygiene` fingerprints
will not match the baseline's byte-for-byte: `creditWallet`/`debitWallet`
moved from `server.js:74220`/`:74280` to `:74445`/`:74505`, and the
fingerprint is `sha256(detector|ruleId|location|severity)` — line drift alone
re-fingerprints an unchanged finding. That is a known property of the scheme,
not a new defect; it is why this ledger records *shape*, not line numbers, as
the identity of a finding.

## 2. Is the info tier still run-to-run unstable?

CLAUDE.md says the `macro-usage` detector "emits RUNTIME telemetry, so the
info tier (and therefore the total) genuinely varies run-to-run." **That is now
mostly stale, and the mechanism is narrower than the sentence implies.**

- Fingerprints are `sha256(detector|ruleId|location|severity)`
  (`server/lib/detectors/baseline.js:17`) — **the message text is not
  hashed.** `macro_usage_summary`'s counts can change freely without changing
  its fingerprint or the total.
- `macro-usage-detector.js` was changed in the "zero-tech-debt sweep" to stop
  emitting per-macro `dispatcher_reach` / retirement-candidate findings; its
  own comment says they are "observational data, not actionable bugs" and are
  "counted in the summary, not emitted as per-macro findings"
  (`macro-usage-detector.js:118-131`). The detector produced **2 findings this
  run**, not the 153 that `BUDGET.json` v13's rationale describes.
- The one surviving variance vector is `macro_runtime_live`
  (`macro-usage-detector.js:110`): a per-macro info finding emitted for a
  macro that has **zero static call sites**, is dispatcher/manifest-reachable,
  **and** fired inside the 30-day telemetry window. It reported `0
  runtime-live` this run (`audit/detectors/macro-telemetry.jsonl` holds 277
  aggregated rows, but they are for macros that do have static call sites, so
  none qualify). If a zero-callsite macro ever fires, the info tier grows by
  one finding per such macro.

So: the info tier is *currently* stable, and the variance that remains is
bounded and identifiable rather than diffuse. Where a number below could
move for that reason, it is called out.

## 3. Per-finding ledger

Every one of the 60 findings, read at the source rather than inferred from
the message. Cluster column keys to §4.

### 3.1 HIGH — 7 findings

| # | Detector · rule | Location | What the code actually is | Cluster |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | `money-txn-hygiene` · `money_txn_untransacted_writes` | `server/economy/ledger.js:51` `recordTransaction()` | `try` INSERT into `economy_ledger` **with** `ref_id`; `catch` re-runs the *same* INSERT without it, and only when the error message names that column, else re-throws. Two static writes, one runtime write. | A1 |
| H2 | same | `server/economy/stripe.js:188` `handleWebhook()` | Two `economy_withdrawals` writes in different `switch` cases (`transfer.paid` vs `transfer.failed`); `event.type` selects exactly one per delivery. Handler is idempotent via `isEventProcessed`; the delegate `_reverseFailedWithdrawal` owns its own `db.transaction(...)`. | A1 |
| H3 | same | `server/lib/account-lifecycle.js:42` `requestAccountDeletion()` | Read in full: `if (balance > 0.01)` INSERTs into `account_deletion_requests` and **returns**; the `else` path delegates to `executeAccountDeletion`, which wraps its 18 steps in one transaction. Strictly either/or. The message's `tables: balance_at_request` is a **column** name lifted out of the INSERT column list — the detector's table extraction misfiring, which is itself further FP evidence. | A1 |
| H4 | same | `server/routes/wagers.js:12` `createWagersRouter()` | A router **factory**. Its "5 delegated writes" are 5 separate Express route-handler closures, each running on a distinct HTTP request. Attributing all five to the factory function is an artifact of function-scope attribution. All four delegates wrap their balance mutation + status write in `db.transaction(...)`. | A1 |
| H5 | same | `server/server.js:74445` `creditWallet()` | Verified at the live line: primary `INSERT INTO economy_ledger (… ref_id)`, then `catch (e) { if (e.message?.includes('ref_id')) { … INSERT without ref_id … } }`. Column-fallback, never sequential. | A1 |
| H6 | same | `server/server.js:74505` `debitWallet()` | Identical shape to H5. | A1 |
| H7 | `authz-coverage` · `authz_write_auth_bypass` | `server/server.js:7331` | `/api/welding/portal/` in `WRITE_AUTH_PUBLIC_PATHS`. Reviewed anonymous-customer portal token; the token is the access control, scoped server-side to one estimate/invoice. Documented inline directly above the array and at the route handlers, and security-tested end-to-end. | A2 |

### 3.2 INFO — everything carrying a real location, plus the three counted rollups — 25 findings

| # | Detector · rule | Location | What the code actually is | Cluster |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | `fake-data` · `fake_ident_in_production` | `concord-frontend/components/studio/MixerPeekStrip.tsx:41` (defn), `:159`, `:186` (uses) | 🔴 **`fakeLevel(volume)` synthesizes a VU-meter level from `Date.now()` and a sine wave and renders it as a live per-track meter.** Its own comment: *"Real per-track post-fader RMS would require feeding the audio analyser node into here, which we can wire later."* | **C1 — real defect** |
| I2 | same | `concord-frontend/components/desert/DesertOfflineMapView.tsx:66`, `:71` | `placeholderBlobPromise` memoizes a canvas-drawn tile that *says* "cached tile isn't available offline" — an honest unavailable-state graphic, not fabricated data. | B3 |
| I3 | same | `concord-frontend/components/foundry/FoundryCanvas.tsx:191` | `stubNote` builds `" (N system(s) pending Phase 7)"` from `r.skippedStubs` — an **honest disclosure** appended to a success toast so the user is told what was *not* published. | B3 |
| I4 | `frontend-fake-data` · `placeholder_content_weak` | `concord-frontend/app/lenses/metacognition/page.tsx:1258` | The term is inside a CSS attribute selector: `document.querySelector('input[placeholder*="Domain to assess"]')`. A DOM query, not rendered content. | B2 |
| I5 | same | `concord-frontend/components/app-maker/AppBuilderStudio.tsx:418` | `updateProp('placeholder', e.target.value)` — the property editor for the `placeholder` prop of an input the *user* is designing. Legitimate field name. | B2 |
| I6 | same | `concord-frontend/components/legacy/CodebaseScanner.tsx:232` | `<Metric label="TODO / FIXME Debt" value={String(active.summary.totalTodos)} />` — "TODO" is the metric's **subject**; the value comes from a real scan result. | B2 |
| I7 | same | `concord-frontend/components/studio/BouncePanel.tsx:100` | A tooltip that says *"The reference audio attached to this publish is a generated placeholder tone (4s, 220Hz), not your project mix."* Flagged **for being honest about a placeholder** — the detector's `NEGATION_RE` covers denials ("never sample data") but not affirmative disclosures. | B2 |
| I8–I15 | `env-config-drift` · `magic_timeout` | `astronomy/SkyChartWorkbench.tsx:164`, `fashion/FashionAIStylistPanel.tsx:57`, `fitness/StravaBeaconPanel.tsx:162`, `fitness/StravaGpsPanel.tsx:88`, `fitness/StravaSegmentsPanel.tsx:102`, `space/OwnedSatellites.tsx:147`, `space/SkyMap.tsx:68`, `space/VisiblePassPredictor.tsx:81` | **All eight are the same thing**: the `timeout` field of a `PositionOptions` object passed to `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` / `watchPosition` (10000 or 15000 ms). A W3C browser-API parameter, not deployment config. | B1 |
| I16 | `architectural-hub` · `architectural_leaf_utility` | `server/lib/lru-map.js` | fan-in 98, fan-out 0. | A3 |
| I17 | same | `server/logger.js` | fan-in 319, fan-out 0. | A3 |
| I18 | `lens-health` · `lens_unknown_domain` | `concord-frontend/app/lenses/world/page.tsx:6242` (was `:6222` when first triaged — see note below) | `domain: 'mainland'` is a field on a **quest object literal** passed to `<QuestLog>` (rendered as display text at `QuestLog.tsx:73`; defaulted at `:136`). It is not a `/api/lens/run` macro domain. The rule matches `domain: "x"` anywhere in a file that also contains a `lensRun` call — and this file is 6,000+ lines with many. | C2 |
| I19 | `macro-usage` · `dispatcher_reach` | `server/routes/domain.js:225` | Notes that an open `// @macro-dispatcher` file makes every macro reachable, which is why per-macro zero-callsite findings are downgraded. Structural note. | A4 |
| I20 | `authz-coverage` · `authz_central_gate_ok` | `server/server.js` | A **positive** assertion: global write-auth gate present at mount line 7353, 648 mutating routes behind it, 8 bypass paths. This finding firing is the healthy state. | A4 |
| I21 | `stale-code` · `route_orphan_summary` | (no location) | "546 route(s) declared but not statically referenced… manual triage required for retirement." | C3 |
| I22 | `fake-data` · `fake_data_summary` | (no location) | "2250 unit test(s) mock production modules… Per-mock findings suppressed (each is a legitimate test isolation; migration is a test-PR concern)." | C4 |

## 4. Clusters

### (a) DOCUMENTED-FALSE-POSITIVE — the detector's own source names the class

#### A1 — `money_txn_untransacted_writes` × 6 · **no annotation mechanism exists**

`money-txn-hygiene-detector.js`'s header names five of these six call sites
**verbatim**, in a section titled "Known precision limit — no control-flow
awareness":

> *"…it counts call SITES, not reachable execution paths. Two write call sites
> that are actually MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE — an if/else branch, a switch-case, or
> a try/catch fallback pattern ('attempt with ref_id column, catch → retry
> without it') — are indistinguishable, from pure text, from two writes that
> always run back-to-back. Real examples found scanning this repo:
> `economy/ledger.js#recordTransaction` (try/catch column-fallback),
> `server.js#creditWallet`/`debitWallet` (same fallback shape),
> `economy/stripe.js#handleWebhook` (separate `switch` cases), and
> `lib/account-lifecycle.js#requestAccountDeletion` (if-balance vs
> else-immediate-delete) all trip the >=2-writes-no-transaction rule without
> being the sequential-composition bug this detector targets. **Accept these
> as a known noise class rather than a detector bug.**"*

H4 (`wagers.js#createWagersRouter`) is not named by name but is the same
documented limitation applied to a router factory — function-scope
attribution across sibling route closures.

**Annotation: none.** `grep -E '@[a-z-]+-ok|detector-allow'
server/lib/detectors/money-txn-hygiene-detector.js` returns **0 matches**.
There is no per-call-site escape hatch for this rule, so no site can carry
one, and none does. The only sanctioned closure is the baseline — which is
exactly what happened on 2026-07-25, with recorded owner authorization.

Separately, and worth not re-deriving: wrapping `creditWallet`/`debitWallet`
in `db.transaction(...)` **cannot** fix the reported concern, because the
wallet balance those functions mutate lives in an in-memory `Map` that a SQL
transaction cannot roll back. The existing construction — a compensating
in-memory reversal on a genuine ledger-write failure — is the correct one.

**Disposition: no code fix. Already baselined. Do not re-dispatch.**

#### A2 — `authz_write_auth_bypass` × 1 · **no annotation mechanism exists**

The detector's own message states the resolution mechanism inline:
*"intentional bypasses are baselined; a NEW one needs review."* Its header
(§"What this detector actually asserts", rule 3) makes the same point: *"Each
non-infrastructure bypass is a finding so the baseline captures the current
set; a NEWLY-added unauthenticated-write path becomes a new finding the PR
gate surfaces for human review."* **Firing is the design.**

The review it asks for exists and is written down twice in the source (a
comment block above `WRITE_AUTH_PUBLIC_PATHS` and a `NOTE:` on the array line
itself) and is backed by a live proof file — `server/tests/e2e/welding-portal-routes.test.js`
**verified present on disk**, covering cross-tenant isolation, invalid-token
rejection, and no fabricated payment success.

The detector carries an in-source `INFRA_BYPASS` allowlist for auth-bootstrap
paths, but that list is deliberately generic-infrastructure only; a
product-specific portal correctly does not belong in it, which is why this
one is a baseline entry rather than a detector edit.

**Annotation: none.** 0 matches for any `-ok` token in
`authz-coverage-detector.js`. **Disposition: no code fix. Already baselined.**

#### A3 — `architectural_leaf_utility` × 2

The detector demotes these to `info` itself and says why, in the message
(*"leaf utility — wide use is by design"*) and in the source at
`architectural-hub-detector.js:93-99`: *"a module with fan-out 0 imports
nothing local, so it does no orchestration work. Loggers, type-only re-export
modules, constants files all land here. They are widely imported by design;
'splitting' them just moves the leaf to a different path. Demote to info, not
'split risk'."* `lru-map.js` and `logger.js` are exactly the two examples the
comment describes.

**Annotation: none needed** (the rule self-demotes). **Disposition: none.**

#### A4 — observational/positive findings × 2 + the 28 rollups

`dispatcher_reach` (I19) and the suppressed per-macro findings behind it are
described in the detector's own source as *"observational data, not
actionable bugs"* (`macro-usage-detector.js:127-131`).
`authz_central_gate_ok` (I20) is a **positive** assertion — it firing means
the gate is intact. The 31 `*_summary` findings are scan-coverage rollups.

**Disposition: none. These 30 findings are not debt and should not appear in
any work list.** Together with A1–A3 they are why "60 findings" overstates the
actual debt by roughly an order of magnitude.

### (b) SHARED-ROOT-CAUSE — one pattern, N sites

#### B1 — `magic_timeout` × 8 · one root cause: the Geolocation API

All eight findings are `{ …, timeout: 10000|15000 }` inside a
`PositionOptions` object passed to `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition`
or `watchPosition`. Verified individually — all eight, not sampled. This is a
W3C-specified browser-API field with a fixed meaning (how long to wait for a
GPS fix before invoking the error callback), and every one of the eight sites
pairs it with a real, honest error callback (`"Location denied: …"`,
`"GPS error: …"`). There is no legitimate second value for a deployment to
hold.

**This is NOT a documented FP class** — `env-config-drift-detector.js` has
zero mentions of geolocation, `getCurrentPosition`, or `PositionOptions`
(grep confirms 0 hits), and `TIMEOUT_RE` matches any `timeout: <5-7 digits>`
that is not guarded by `process.env.`. The classification above is this
pass's determination from reading all eight sites, not a citation.

**Single fix, one pattern:** the sanctioned annotation is
`@env-config-ok` (`env-config-drift-detector.js:110`,
`ANNOTATION_OK_RE = /@env-config-ok\b/`). It is checked **twice** — against
the whole file content (file-scoped suppression) and against the individual
finding's line — so one comment per file closes it. **No site currently
carries one.** Eight one-line comments, each stating the real reason
(*"browser Geolocation `PositionOptions.timeout`, a W3C API parameter, not
deployment config"*), closes the entire cluster. Precedent already exists in
this repo: the 2026-07-24 pass closed 8 different `env-config-drift` findings
this same way.

Alternative disposition, equally defensible: leave them. They are `info`,
they cost nothing, and eight annotations is eight more comments to maintain.

#### B2 — `placeholder_content_weak` × 4 · one root cause: term-position blindness

All four are the words `placeholder` / `TODO` appearing in a **non-content
position**: a CSS attribute selector (I4), a prop-editor field name (I5), a
metric label whose subject *is* TODO debt (I6), and an honest disclosure
tooltip (I7). None is fabricated content rendered as real. The detector
already carries defenses for several sibling shapes — a `PLACEHOLDER_ATTR_RE`
exemption for the `placeholder="…"` JSX attribute, a Tailwind
`placeholder-`/`placeholder:` guard, an import-specifier skip, and a
`NEGATION_RE` for honest denials — so this is the same family of
term-position problem it already handles, just four positions it does not yet
cover.

I7 deserves a specific note: it is flagged **because the code is honest**. A
tooltip that tells the user the attached audio is a generated placeholder
tone rather than their mix is precisely the honest-failure construction this
project mandates, and saying so trips the keyword scan. That is the same
self-inflicted-false-positive shape CLAUDE.md already documents for the
UX-polish grader.

**Single fix, one pattern:** `// detector-allow: frontend-fake-data <reason>`
on the flagged line or up to 4 lines above (`LINE_ALLOW_RE`,
`frontend-fake-data-detector.js:75`); `@frontend-fake-data-ok-file` suppresses
a whole file. **No site currently carries either.** Four line comments.

#### B3 — `fake_ident_in_production` × 3 · one root cause: honest-placeholder naming

`placeholderBlobPromise` ×2 (I2) and `stubNote` ×1 (I3) are identifiers whose
*name* contains a fake-data keyword while the *code* is the honest-failure
path: an explicit "tile unavailable offline" graphic, and a disclosure of how
many systems were skipped as stubs. The detector already exempts
`_`-prefixed identifiers, a `dummy*` domain-noun allowlist, and a
`mockOpenAI`-style runtime-mode allowlist — the same family of
name-vs-behavior problem, three names it does not cover.

**Single fix, one pattern:** `@fake-data-ok` on the line or up to 6 lines
above (`fake-data-detector.js:162-167`). **No site currently carries one.**
Two files, three comments (or two, if the two `DesertOfflineMapView` hits sit
within six lines of one comment — they are 5 lines apart, so one placed at
`:66` covers both).

### (c) INDEPENDENT — standalone, needs its own work

#### C1 — 🔴 `MixerPeekStrip` fabricates its VU meters while a real RMS API sits unused

**This is the one real defect in the run, and it is a zero-demo-content
violation of the exact shape CLAUDE.md names as a hard invariant.** It is
sitting at `info` severity only because the detector that caught it works by
identifier naming.

The finding, verified end to end:

- `concord-frontend/components/studio/MixerPeekStrip.tsx:41` defines
  `fakeLevel(volume)`, which returns `volume` plus a deterministic
  `Math.sin(Date.now()/800 …)` jitter. Its comment: *"Pseudo-realistic VU
  swing… Looks alive without being misleading. Real per-track post-fader RMS
  would require feeding the audio analyser node into here, which we can wire
  later."*
- It is called at `:159` (collapsed meter row) and `:186` (expanded
  channel-strip grid) and fed straight into `<Meter level={level} …>`.
- The component is really mounted: `components/studio/SessionWorkspace.tsx:28`
  imports it, `:177` renders it with the live `project.tracks`.
- **The real substrate already exists and is fully built.**
  `concord-frontend/lib/daw/engine.ts:665` defines a `ChannelMeter` class —
  a per-channel `AnalyserNode` tapped off the post-effects output, with
  `getLevel()` computing true RMS from `getByteTimeDomainData`. Its class
  docstring reads: *"A small AnalyserNode tapped off the post-effects output
  **so MixerPeekStrip can read real-time RMS** without fighting for the master
  analyser."*
- `MixerEngine` exposes it publicly as `getTrackLevel(trackId)` (`:726`) and
  `getAllTrackLevels()` (`:732`), the latter commented *"All track levels in
  one shot. **Used by MixerPeekStrip's RAF loop.**"*
- **Both accessors have zero callers.** `grep -rn "getAllTrackLevels\|getTrackLevel"
  concord-frontend` outside `engine.ts` returns nothing.

So the meter the user watches is a sine wave driven by the volume *slider
position*, while a correct per-channel RMS meter — built for this exact
consumer, documented as being for this exact consumer — is wired into the
audio graph and never read. The comment's own defense ("Looks alive without
being misleading") does not hold: a meter that moves when you drag a fader on
a muted-source track, and moves identically whether audio is playing or not,
misleads by construction.

This is not a detector-tuning question. It is a real fix, and a small one.

**Disposition: real fix, INDEPENDENT.** Not suitable for a mechanical batch —
it needs a RAF/interval loop in `MixerPeekStrip` reading
`mixerEngine.getAllTrackLevels()`, an honest zero/idle state when no
`AudioContext` or no engine instance is available (never a synthesized
fallback), and a check against the existing
`concord-frontend/tests/components/MixerPeekStrip-perf-budget.test.tsx`,
which already tests `meterTickIntervalMs` degradation and is the natural place
to pin the new behavior. Note the existing test file's own header describes
the component's "honest perf-budget degradation" — that honesty framing is
currently true of the *tick rate* and false of the *value being ticked*.

#### C2 — `lens_unknown_domain` "mainland" · verified FP, low value

`domain: 'mainland'` at `world/page.tsx:6242` is a field on a quest object
literal handed to `<QuestLog>`, where it is rendered as display text
(`QuestLog.tsx:73`) and defaulted (`:136`). It is not a macro domain and no
`/api/lens/run` call carries it. The detector's `DOMAIN_REF_RE` matches
`domain: "x"` anywhere in a file that also contains a `lensRun` call; this
6,000-line page has many, so an unrelated object key gets swept in.

The detector documents its *severity* choice (`lens-health-detector.js:165-174`:
unknown domains fall through to the utility-brain catch-all, so `info` not
`high`, after `high` "produced 8 false-positive blockers in CI") but it does
**not** document this key-collision mechanism. So: verified false positive,
undocumented, and there is **no annotation mechanism** on this detector (0
`-ok` tokens).

**Disposition: none. Baseline-absorbed.** Fixing it would mean either editing
a PROTECTED detector or renaming a legitimate domain-model field to dodge a
regex — both worse than the finding.

#### C3 — `route_orphan_summary`: 546 statically-unreferenced routes

A standing backlog, not a run finding. The message itself scopes the work:
*"May include mobile-template URLs, federation peer endpoints, or true
orphans — manual triage required for retirement."* Genuinely large, genuinely
manual, and genuinely low-urgency (an unreferenced route is dead weight, not a
defect). Notably, the sibling `domain-reachability` detector reports **0
unreachable** across 418 domain files and `dead-macro-call` reports **0**
across 10,724 registered pairs — so the macro layer is clean and this is
specifically an HTTP-route-surface question.

**Disposition: separate scoped project. Do not fold into a detector sweep.**

#### C4 — `fake_data_summary`: 2,250 test files mocking production modules

Also a standing backlog with a disposition already written into the message:
*"candidates for fixture-loader migration. Per-mock findings suppressed (each
is a legitimate test isolation; migration is a test-PR concern)."*

**Disposition: none for this sweep.**

## 5. Cluster sizes and prioritized work list

| Cluster | Findings | Class | Real severity | Fix cost | Action |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| **C1** `MixerPeekStrip` fake VU meters | 3 (1 defect) | (c) independent | 🔴 **high** — zero-demo-content violation | small–medium | **Fix.** Wire `getAllTrackLevels()`; honest idle state; pin in the existing perf-budget test. |
| **B1** geolocation `magic_timeout` | 8 | (b) shared root cause | none (verified FP) | trivial | Annotate `@env-config-ok` ×8, or consciously leave. |
| **B2** `placeholder_content_weak` | 4 | (b) shared root cause | none (verified FP) | trivial | Annotate `// detector-allow: frontend-fake-data <reason>` ×4. |
| **B3** `fake_ident_in_production` honest names | 3 | (b) shared root cause | none (verified FP) | trivial | Annotate `@fake-data-ok` ×2–3. |
| **A1** money-txn control-flow blindness | 6 | (a) documented FP | none | n/a — no annotation exists | **Nothing. Already baselined + owner-authorized.** |
| **A2** welding-portal write-auth bypass | 1 | (a) documented FP | none | n/a — no annotation exists | **Nothing. Firing is the design.** |
| **A3** leaf-utility hubs | 2 | (a) documented FP | none | n/a | Nothing. |
| **A4** observational + rollups | 30 | (a) documented FP | none | n/a | Nothing — exclude from all counts of "debt". |
| **C2** "mainland" lens domain | 1 | (c) independent | none (verified FP) | n/a — no annotation exists | Nothing. |
| **C3** 546 orphan routes | 1 (rollup) | (c) independent | low | large | Separate scoped project. |
| **C4** 2,250 test mocks | 1 (rollup) | (c) independent | low | large | Separate scoped project (test-PR venue). |

**Top cluster by value, unambiguously: C1.** It is the only finding in the
entire run that represents a real user-visible defect, and it is the highest
class of defect this project recognizes — fabricated data rendered as live
while the real substrate sits one function call away, which is verbatim the
pattern CLAUDE.md's zero-demo-content invariant describes.

**Everything else is either already-dispositioned false-positive noise (A1–A4,
C2: 40 findings) or trivial annotation work (B1–B3: 15 findings), with 2
standing-backlog rollups (C3, C4) and C1's 3 findings making up the rest —
6+1+2+30+1 + 8+4+3 + 3 + 1+1 = 60.** Of 60 findings, exactly **one** is a
code defect. That ratio is itself the useful
output of this pass: it means a fix-batch dispatched at the raw run would have
spent ~98% of its effort re-deriving conclusions already written down in
detector source comments or in this file.

**Recommended order:**

1. **C1** — the real fix. One agent, one component, one test file.
2. **B1 + B2 + B3** — 15 annotations across 13 files, all verified above, all
   with the exact annotation string recorded. One agent, one commit,
   mechanical. Optional: the honest alternative is to leave all 15, since they
   are `info` and cost nothing but a slightly noisier report.
3. **C3 / C4** — schedule separately; neither belongs to a detector sweep.
4. **A1–A4, C2** — closed. If they reappear in a future dispatch, that
   dispatch is re-doing work; point it here.

## 6. How the live numbers compare to CLAUDE.md — **CLAUDE.md is stale**

Not edited by this pass, per the task's constraint. The specific sentences
that are now wrong, in the "Repo metrics & detector gates" bullet block:

| CLAUDE.md sentence (verbatim fragment) | Live reality (2026-07-25T12:11Z) |
|---|---|
| *"`audit/detectors/BASELINE.json` is **v1, generated 2026-07-19 — 416 fingerprints: 0 critical / 9 high / 201 medium / 7 low / 199 info**"* | The file on disk is v1 **generated 2026-07-25T09:33:19Z with 77 fingerprints: 0 critical / 7 high / 18 medium / 0 low / 53 info**. The 2026-07-19 / 416-fingerprint description is superseded — and CLAUDE.md's own hedge ("Read those files directly rather than trusting a remembered number") is the correct instruction. |
| *"`BUDGET.json` is **v13, `maxTotal` 460** (floor 436 + headroom)"* | `maxTotal` 460 is accurate as a file fact, but the floor it is sized against is gone: the live total is **60**, not 436. The budget now has ~7.7× headroom. Its `perDetector` map is likewise stale in almost every row (e.g. `macro-usage: 160` vs 2 actual, `frontend-fake-data: 45` vs 5, `dead-event-listener: 80` vs 0, `ux-a11y-button-no-label: 42` vs 0, `stale-lying-test: 30` vs 0). |
| *"A live `cd server && node scripts/run-detectors.js` on 2026-07-24 reported 0 critical / 7 high / 196 medium / 8 low / 51 info; treat that as a dated snapshot"* | Correctly labelled as dated, and it is: **0 / 7 / 0 / 0 / 53**. Medium 196 → 0 and low 8 → 0. |
| *"the `macro-usage` detector emits RUNTIME telemetry, so the info tier (and therefore the total) genuinely varies run-to-run, which is why `BUDGET.json` v13's own rationale sizes its headroom to absorb that noise"* | Materially overstated now — see §2. Per-macro `dispatcher_reach`/retirement findings are suppressed in the detector source, fingerprints do not hash the message, and the only live variance vector is `macro_runtime_live`, which reported **0** this run. |
| *"**It is currently RED at 3**, all three triaged as documented false positives… they close via a deliberate baseline refresh"* | **Stale — that refresh happened.** It was owner-authorized on 2026-07-25 (recorded in the historical section below) and applied at commit `855bfe00`. The ratchet is **green**: 7 high, all 7 baselined, zero net-new. |
| *"The perf backlog once cited here (73 high) is closed"* | Still true — `performance-hotspot` reports 1 finding this run, an info rollup. |

Two adjacent staleness notes, for whoever next edits CLAUDE.md — neither is
in CLAUDE.md itself, so they are recorded here rather than in the table above:
`BUDGET.json` v13's `perDetector` map lists **40** detectors and this
document's own historical section says "**44 detectors**"; the live run
registers and executes **46**. (CLAUDE.md's "~30 detectors" is a correct
historical statement about the state at PR #808, not a current count, and
does not need changing.)

---
---

# Historical record — prior passes (append-only)

Everything below predates the current-state section above. Counts in it are
point-in-time and are **not** the live picture. Kept for provenance: it
records what each earlier pass found, decided, and why, which is what stops a
later pass from re-deriving the same conclusions.


## HIGH tier — 2026-07-24 (V1.5 pre-Wave-4 pass)

Driven by one run of `cd server && node scripts/run-detectors.js --diff --ci`,
which reported **17 new high findings** vs the `2026-07-19` baseline (416
fingerprints). Attribution: **none originate in the V1.5 Frontier-Engine
files** — all 17 sit in code shipped earlier in this session (V1.1 R7, V1.4)
or in long-standing `server.js` helpers. Result after this pass: **17 → 3**.

### Cluster A — `perf_sync_fs_in_handler` × 14 → RESOLVED

One root cause: synchronous `fs` calls inside function bodies. Triaged per
site rather than blanket-annotated, because the honest answer differed:

| Site | Real shape | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `server/lib/audit-export.js` ×5 | Reached from a **live HTTP handler** (`GET /api/admin/audit-export`, `server.js:61107`) and reads multi-megabyte artifacts (`audit/macro-depth.json`) — a genuine event-loop stall for every other request while an admin downloads an evidence pack. | **Real fix.** `readJsonArtifact`/`fileFreshness` converted to `fs/promises`; the four section builders and `buildAuditExport` await them (`Promise.all`, so the pack assembles no slower). Awaiting `ENOENT` also replaced the `existsSync`-then-read pair, closing its TOCTOU window. Pinned green by `tests/audit-export.test.js` (8/8). |
| `server/lib/world-calendar.js` ×2 | Lazy, memoized per-world `calendar.json` load (`_calendarCache`) — one small read per world per process, explicitly modeled on `world-flavor.js`'s loops.json load, which already carries the same annotation. | **Annotate** `@sync-fs-ok`. |
| `server/lib/foundry/promote.js` ×1 | `writePromotedContent` writes meta/npcs/factions/lore as one coherent set for a low-frequency, admin-initiated promotion — same shape as the annotated `foundry-publisher.js` publish write. | **Annotate** `@sync-fs-ok`. |
| `server/lib/world-template-pack.js` ×4 | One-shot operator-initiated pack export/import (also a CLI, `scripts/world-template-pack.mjs`); the import path **depends on ordered writes for its rollback** — it tracks each written file so a mid-loop failure unlinks exactly what it created. Same class as the annotated `dtu-portability.js#exportUserCorpus`. | **Annotate** `@sync-fs-ok`. |
| `server/plugins/loader.js` ×2 | `loadPluginsFromDisk` is the boot-time `installed/` scan — single caller on `server.js`'s startup path, and its documented contract is a **synchronous return** (only per-plugin activation is async). Boot ordering, not per-request work. | **Annotate** `@sync-fs-ok`. |

### Cluster B — `money_txn_untransacted_writes` × 2 → documented false positive, NOT fixable in code

`server.js#creditWallet` (74192) and `#debitWallet` (74252) are **named
verbatim** in `money-txn-hygiene-detector.js`'s own header as members of its
documented noise class:

> *"Known precision limit — no control-flow awareness… two write call sites
> that are actually MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE — an if/else branch, a switch-case, or
> a try/catch fallback pattern ('attempt with ref_id column, catch → retry
> without it')… Real examples found scanning this repo: … `server.js#creditWallet`/
> `debitWallet` (same fallback shape) … Accept these as a known noise class
> rather than a detector bug."*

Confirmed by reading the code: the two writes are the primary
`INSERT … ref_id` and its `catch`-branch fallback for pre-migration DBs —
never sequential. Separately, wrapping them in `db.transaction(...)` **cannot
work** and the source already says why: the wallet balance lives in an
in-memory `Map`, so a SQL transaction could not roll it back. The existing
fix (from the earlier money-txn atomicity pass) is a compensating in-memory
reversal on a genuine ledger-write failure — the correct construction here.

No annotation mechanism exists for this detector. **Disposition: baseline.**

### Cluster C — `authz-coverage` × 1 → reviewed intentional bypass, NOT fixable in code

`/api/welding/portal/` in `WRITE_AUTH_PUBLIC_PATHS` (`server.js:7331`). The
detector's own message states the resolution mechanism: *"intentional bypasses
are baselined; a NEW one needs review."* The review is already written inline
above the array and at the route handlers: an anonymous customer using an
unguessable single-purpose portal token, no Concord account to authenticate
against, the token itself is the access control, scoped server-side to exactly
one estimate/invoice — and it is security-tested end-to-end in
`server/tests/e2e/welding-portal-routes.test.js` (verified present; covers
cross-tenant isolation, invalid-token rejection, and no fabricated payment
success).

It reads as "new" only because the baseline predates the route.
**Disposition: baseline.**

### Cluster D — the 4 already-baselined `money-txn-hygiene` highs → audited, all class (a)

The three clusters above cover only the findings that were NEW versus the
baseline. A full (non-diff) run reports **7 high findings total** — the 3 above
plus 4 that were already baselined but had never been audited as real (BUDGET
v13's own rationale described them as "the pre-existing 4 real net-new deferred
to a later audit"). That audit has now run. **All four are class (a): the writes
cannot both execute on one path, and every delegate owns its own transaction.**
No code changed.

| Finding | Why it cannot be a sequential-composition bug |
|---|---|
| `economy/ledger.js:51` `recordTransaction()` | The two INSERTs are a try/catch column-fallback: the `catch` re-attempts without `ref_id` **only** when the error message names that column, and re-throws otherwise. SQLite wraps a lone statement in an implicit transaction, so a failed first attempt writes zero rows. `tests/ledger.test.js` already exercises both the fallback and the re-throw path. |
| `economy/stripe.js:188` `handleWebhook()` | The two `economy_withdrawals` writes sit in different `switch` cases (`transfer.paid` vs `transfer.failed`); `event.type` selects exactly one per delivery. The delegate `_reverseFailedWithdrawal` already wraps its status-revert + REVERSAL ledger insert in its own `db.transaction(...)`. |
| `lib/account-lifecycle.js:41` `requestAccountDeletion()` | `if (balance > 0.01)` schedules deletion; the `else` delegates to `executeAccountDeletion`, which wraps all 18 of its steps in one transaction. Strictly either/or. |
| `routes/wagers.js:12` `createWagersRouter()` | The 5 "delegated" writes are spread across 5 **separate Express route handler closures** registered by the factory — they only ever run on distinct HTTP requests, so they are as mutually exclusive as an if/else, just gated by which route fired. The one handler with two delegate calls (`accept`) picks between them with an early `return`. Independently verified: all four delegates (`_executeProposal`, `_executeAcceptance`, `_executeResolution`, `_cancelAndRefund`, `routes/wagers.js:190–222`) wrap their balance mutation + status write in `db.transaction(...)`. |

Verification: the four cited atomicity/fault-injection test files
(`tests/wagers-atomicity.test.js`, `tests/economy/stripe-webhook-atomicity.test.js`,
`tests/account-lifecycle-deletion.test.js`, `tests/ledger.test.js`) were re-run
by the conductor without `--test-force-exit` — **108 pass / 0 fail**.

One optional hardening note, deliberately NOT acted on: `recordTransaction`'s
test asserts the inserted row's `amount` but never `COUNT(*) = 1` after the
fallback path. Mutual exclusivity there is structurally guaranteed by SQLite's
implicit-transaction-per-statement behavior rather than by the test, so this is
a nice-to-have assertion, not a gap covering a suspected bug.

### Residual ratchet state — resolved by authorized baseline refresh

Every one of the **7** high findings is now audited and none is a code defect:
3 new (Clusters B + C) and 4 pre-existing (Cluster D), all documented false
positives or reviewed-intentional bypasses, none with an annotation mechanism
available. The sanctioned resolution for exactly this situation is a
**deliberate baseline refresh**.

**That refresh is authorized** — the repo owner reviewed this triage on
2026-07-24 and directed that the false positives be allowed. Recording it here
because `audit/detectors/BASELINE.json` is `guard.mjs`-PROTECTed: a future
reader finding 7 high findings sitting in the baseline should be able to see
*why* they were accepted and by whose decision, rather than discovering them
silently absorbed. The refresh is still its own scoped commit, never a side
effect of unrelated work, and softening a detector remains not an option.

---

## MEDIUM / LOW tiers — 2026-07-24

Driven by the SAME single detector run as the high tier above (one
`cd server && node scripts/run-detectors.js`, JSON captured once and analysed
offline — the point of this phase is that fix-dispatches start from computed
context instead of re-running and re-deriving per finding).

**Real totals from that run: 0 critical / 7 high / 196 medium / 8 low / 51 info.**
Ten detectors account for all 204 medium+low; five account for 184 of the 196
medium. `info` is excluded by design — it is dominated by `macro-usage` runtime
telemetry, which is not a defect signal and varies run-to-run.

| Count | Sev | Detector | Bucket |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 47 | medium | `stale-lying-test` | (b) one root cause |
| 41 | medium | `ux-a11y-button-no-label` | (b) one root cause |
| 35 | medium | `frontend-fake-data` | (a)+(c) split — see below |
| 34 | medium | `dead-event-listener` | (b)+(c) split |
| 27 | medium | `frontend-unsafe-chain` | (b) one root cause |
| 8 | medium | `env-config-drift` | (c) mixed, small |
| 6 | low | `performance-hotspot` (`SELECT *`) | (a) annotation available |
| 3 | medium | `stale-code` | (a) likely migration artifacts |
| 2 | low | `fake-data` (TODO markers) | (c) trivial |
| 1 | medium | `command-injection` | (c) real, but PROTECTED path |

### (b) One root cause each — dispatch as a single unit, not N findings

- **`stale-lying-test` (47).** Tests that regex/substring-match source text
  instead of exercising behavior, so they cannot fail when the behavior breaks.
  Prior batches (DET-A, DET-B) established the conversion pattern: import the
  real function and invoke it with spies, or render + `fireEvent` + assert.
  Never rename a title to dodge the detector.
- **`ux-a11y-button-no-label` (41).** Icon-only `<button>`s with no accessible
  name. Mechanical, and a real accessibility win rather than lint appeasement.
  Heaviest: `custom/DataUtilities.tsx` (6), `privacy/DpoStudioPanel.tsx` (5),
  `bio/BioResearchPanel.tsx` (3), `meta/DevPortal.tsx` (3).
- **`frontend-unsafe-chain` (27).** ~~Nested access 2+ levels deep with no
  guard.~~ **Worked 2026-07-24 — the "one root cause" framing was wrong, and
  the outcome is 27 → 26, not 27 → 0.** Only ONE of the 27 was a real bug;
  the other 26 are a single documented detector blind spot. See the
  dedicated subsection below.

### WORKED — `frontend-unsafe-chain`: 1 real bug, 26 documented false positives

Result: **27 → 26.** The cluster did not go to zero, and that is the correct
end state, not incomplete work.

**The one real bug** (`components/art/ConceptArtBoard.tsx:65`): the error path
read `r.data?.result?.ok === false` and `r.data.result.error`. But `lensRun`
(`lib/api/client.ts`) already unwraps the `/api/lens/run` `{ok, result}`
envelope — tolerating single OR double wrap — before it resolves, so a macro's
success/failure lands at `r.data.ok`/`r.data.error`, never nested under
`r.data.result`. `art.concept-art-list` returns `{ok, result:{conceptArt,count}}`,
which after the double-unwrap leaves `r.data.result` as a flat
`{conceptArt, count}` with no `.ok`/`.error` on it at all. So the check was
structurally always-undefined and the error branch **could never fire** — a
real "db unavailable" or query failure silently rendered an empty board while
the component's own error banner sat unreachable. Fixed to read the real
contract; the existing banner is now actually reachable.

**The 26 false positives** are one shape, verified individually rather than
pattern-matched: `if (x?.a?.b) { …x.a.b… }` — an optional-chained guard
followed by a plain-dot read of the exact same, now-proven-truthy path. That
is crash-safe by JS short-circuit semantics, and it is literally the idiom the
detector's own docstring holds up as correct (`if (payload?.items)
payload.items.map(…)`). It gets flagged anyway because the guard text contains
`?.` where the detector's substring match expects plain dots. Two variants:
`world/ZoneBadge.tsx:54` guards with a ternary rather than an `if`, and
`world-creator/DraftEditor.tsx:193` is guarded by an earlier `if (!r.data?.ok
|| !r.data.result) return;` early-return (its reported chain is also a regex
mismatch — the real expression is `r.data.result.worldPayload`).

Spot-checked independently by the conductor at
`mentorship/MentorshipSessionsPanel.tsx:103`, `world/ZoneBadge.tsx:54`, and
`world-lens/SeasonalEffects.tsx:108` — all three genuinely guarded.

**Resolution: the detector was fixed, with authorization — 26 → 1.**

Rewriting 26 correct guards into a shape the regex liked was never an option:
that is worse code written to satisfy a checker, the exact inversion this
project exists to prevent. The real defect was in the checker.
`hasPrecedingPrefixGuard` built its pattern with `escapeRegExp(prefixText)`,
producing literal dots, so a prefix recorded as `r.data.result.session` could
never match the guard text `r.data?.result?.session`. Fixed by allowing each
`.` to appear as `?.` in the guard, plus recognising the ternary guard form
(`data?.zone ? … : null`).

Accepting `a?.b` where `a.b` was expected cannot hide a real unguarded chain —
the optional form proves strictly more about the path, since it also survives a
null `a`. The ternary branch carries a `(?!\.)` lookahead so a *continuing*
optional chain (`r.data?.result`) is never misread as a ternary test, which
would have been a genuine loosening.

Pinned bidirectionally in `server/tests/frontend-unsafe-chain-detector.test.js`
(14/14): both guarded shapes go quiet, the genuinely unguarded control
(`r.data.result.sessions.map(…)`, no guard anywhere) **still trips**, and the
continuing-optional-chain case still trips. A one-directional test here would
have proved nothing — a detector that stopped flagging the control would be
softened, not fixed.

**One residual, disposition baseline:** `world-creator/DraftEditor.tsx:193` is
a *different* blind spot — guarded by an early-return negative
(`if (!r.data?.ok || !r.data.result) { …; return; }`) rather than a positive
`if (x) {…}`. Recognising that requires reasoning about whether the `return`
actually exits, which regex cannot do safely; broadening for it would risk
real false negatives. Left flagged and documented rather than papered over.

Note on scope: `scripts/autoloop/guard.mjs`'s PROTECTED list covers detector
**baselines** (`BASELINE.json`, `BUDGET.json`) and the named grader scripts —
detector *sources* are not in that regex list. The rule that governs a change
like this one is CLAUDE.md's: a checker fix is permitted only as a
bidirectional correctness fix with a pinning test and explicit human
authorization. Both held here.

### (a)/(c) split — `frontend-fake-data` (35), needs per-finding judgment

The detector flags "hardcoded array literal rendered via `.map()` with no
data-fetching call in the enclosing scope." That heuristic cannot distinguish
two very different things, and both are present:

- **Static UI configuration** — `TABS` (3 objects), `DESTINATIONS` (3–4),
  `GROUPS` (4). A hardcoded tab strip or nav group is not fabricated data
  presented as live; it is the component's own structure. False-positive class.
- **Real fallback datasets** — e.g. `ANSWERS_FALLBACK` (30 objects, 8 fields).
  A 30-row hand-authored dataset rendered where real data belongs is exactly
  the zero-demo-content violation the detector exists to catch.

`audit/detectors/BUDGET.json` v13's rationale already records a disposition for
this cluster: these are "real per-file hardcoded-array-rendered-as-live-data
flags the Frontend Rebuild Program's per-lens passes are the sanctioned venue
to close, not a one-off fix here." That remains right — a lens's fabricated
data should be replaced during that lens's rebuild, where the real backend
capability is in view. Recommended handling: split the 35 by size/shape, close
the genuine ones through the rebuild program, and leave the static-config ones
documented as the known FP class.

### (b)/(c) split — `dead-event-listener` (34)

Ghost listeners: `addEventListener`/`useEventListener` subscribing to an event
nothing dispatches, so the listener is a no-op. Examples: `anim:active-frame`,
`conkay:dismiss`, `concordia:open-curtain`, `concordia:link-scan-toggle`,
`concordia:open-roguelite-shop`, `concordia:open-size-scaling`. This is the
DET-C class, and the standing rule is honest either way: **wire a real trigger
or retire the listener** — never leave a no-op that implies a feature exists.
Per-item judgment is required (several are "open-panel" HUD listeners whose
trigger was never built), so this is one dispatch with N decisions, not one
mechanical sweep. Use the runtime detector, not raw grep — the shared-const and
subscribe-over-array idioms in this codebase defeat grep, and that has produced
false "dead" conclusions before.

### (a) Low-effort / already-dispositioned

- **`performance-hotspot` `SELECT *` (6, low)** — `domains/admin.js` (3),
  `domains/education.js` (3). The detector supports a sanctioned
  `@select-star-ok: <reason>` per-call-site annotation and deliberately does
  NOT flag pinpoint `WHERE id = ?` lookups; these 6 are full-scan/JOIN shapes.
  Either project explicit columns or annotate with a real reason.
- **`stale-code` (3)** — tables created in migrations but never read outside
  them (`economy_ledger_new` in `379_agent_marathon_governance.js` ×2,
  `372_ledger_staking_types.js` ×1). The `_new` suffix is the signature of a
  table-rebuild migration's temp table, which is correctly never read at
  runtime. Verify and document rather than "fix."
- **`fake-data` (2, low)** — TODO markers in `ui/Skeleton.tsx` and
  `domains/foundry.js`. Trivial: resolve or delete the marker.

### (c) The one that needs a human decision — `command-injection` (1)

`scripts/autoloop/lib.mjs:21` — `run(cmd)` passes a non-literal string to
`execSync`, i.e. a shell-injection sink. Traced: most callers pass literals,
but `scripts/autoloop/guard.mjs:62,64` interpolate a file path taken from
`git diff --name-only`. The path is wrapped with `JSON.stringify`, which
handles spaces — but `$(...)` and backticks **still expand inside double
quotes in bash**, so a file committed with a name like `$(...)` would execute
on the next guard run. Narrow (requires a maliciously-named file to reach the
repo, and this is dev tooling, not production) but genuinely the same class the
detector was added for after a real `execSync` sink reached merge.

**Not fixed, deliberately.** `guard.mjs`'s own PROTECTED list contains
`/^scripts\/autoloop\//` — the entire directory, including both the sink and
its callers. Editing it is the same explicitly-authorized-only action as a
baseline refresh, not something to slip into a sweep. The fix itself is small
when authorized: use `execFileSync` with an argv array at those two call sites
(and read the file with `readFileSync` instead of shelling out to `cat`).

### Recommended fix order

1. `ux-a11y-button-no-label` (41) — unambiguous, mechanical, real user benefit.
2. `frontend-unsafe-chain` (27) — unambiguous, with a documented precedent fix.
3. `stale-lying-test` (47) — largest, established pattern, but each conversion
   is real work; these tests are currently providing false assurance, which is
   worse than no test.
4. `dead-event-listener` (34) — per-item judgment.
5. The small buckets, then `frontend-fake-data` through the rebuild program.

## WORKED — the four small buckets (2026-07-25)

`performance-hotspot` `SELECT *` (6), `stale-code` (3), `fake-data` TODO
markers (2), `env-config-drift` hardcoded URLs (8) — 19 findings, dispatched
together as one small-bucket unit. Result: **19 → 3** (the 3 residual
`stale-code` findings are a verified-correct idiom, documented below, not a
defect — see disposition).

### `performance-hotspot` `SELECT *` (6, low) → RESOLVED, 6 → 0

All six were the `listAll()` full-table-scan queries in the db-backed store
facades of `domains/admin.js` (`admin_alert_rules`, `admin_feature_flags`,
`admin_incidents`) and `domains/education.js` (`edu_courses`,
`edu_discussions`, `edu_cohorts`) — never the pinpoint `WHERE id = ?` lookups
next to them, which the detector correctly leaves alone. Each table's
`rowTo*` mapper names its exact field set 1:1 against the migration's
`CREATE TABLE` (364 for admin, 363 for education), so projecting explicit
columns was unambiguous — no annotation needed. `admin_incidents` is the one
case where the projection is a genuine narrowing: `rowToIncident` never reads
back `created_at` (only `incidentToParams` writes it on insert), so the
explicit column list correctly omits it. Verified with
`server/tests/{admin-domain-parity,admin-ops-persistence,education-catalog-persistence,education-domain-parity,education-lens-macros,ops-substrate-admin-gate}.test.js`
— 120/120 pass.

### `stale-code` (3, medium) → verified real idiom, disposition: baseline

`agent_marathon_sessions_new` + `agent_marathon_sessions_old`
(`server/migrations/379_agent_marathon_governance.js`, lines 70 and 124) and
`economy_ledger_new` (`server/migrations/372_ledger_staking_types.js`, line
34) are the SQLite create-new → copy → drop → rename table-rebuild idiom
(used because SQLite can't `ALTER` a `CHECK` constraint). Read both
migrations in full: `_new` is created, populated via an explicit-column
`INSERT ... SELECT`, then the original table is dropped and `_new` is
renamed onto its name (379's `down()` does the mirror-image rebuild through
an `_old` table). Both migrations already carry a thorough header comment
naming this exact pattern and citing the precedent migration. The temp table
genuinely is "created but never read outside migrations" — that's not a bug,
it's what a rebuild-idiom temp table always looks like, for the tick of time
it exists mid-migration.

No annotation mechanism exists on `stale-code-detector.js`'s `table_orphan`
rule, and per the standing hard rule (`server/lib/detectors/*` is
guard.mjs-protected territory — no casual edits, and CLAUDE.md's migrations
are append-only, so neither the detector nor the two migration files may be
touched to silence this). **Disposition: baseline** — same closure mechanism
as the Cluster B/C findings in the HIGH tier above (verify + document; no
code changed; the 3 findings are absorbed by a deliberate, separately
authorized baseline refresh, not a silent edit).

### `fake-data` TODO markers (2, low) → RESOLVED, 2 → 0

- `concord-frontend/components/ui/Skeleton.tsx:38` — a genuine, still-true
  design-token debt note ("migrate to `ds.skeleton` once the design-system
  agent lands one"); `lib/design-system.ts` confirmed to carry no `skeleton`
  token yet, so the TODO isn't stale and "doing the trivial thing it asks"
  isn't actually trivial (it asks for a not-yet-designed token). Not fake
  data at all — the component only renders honest `animate-pulse`
  placeholders. Resolved with the sanctioned `@fake-data-ok:` annotation
  rather than inventing a token unilaterally.
- `server/domains/foundry.js:502` — not a live TODO; the word "TODO" only
  appeared inside a doc comment's prose ("This closes the TODO in
  compiler.js's header comment...") describing work the `foundry.promote`
  macro had *already* closed. Reworded to "closes the gap noted in..." so
  the prose doesn't spell out the literal flagged keyword — same
  self-inflicted-false-positive shape CLAUDE.md's UI-quality-rubric section
  already warns about for the UX-polish grader.

Verified with `concord-frontend/tests/components/Skeleton.test.tsx` (22/22)
and `server/tests/foundry-promote.test.js` (6/6).

### `env-config-drift` hardcoded URLs (8, medium) → RESOLVED, 8 → 0

Per-site judgment, as expected — all 8 turned out to be genuine false
positives once traced, none needed a real `CONCORD_*` env var:

| Site | Real shape |
|---|---|
| `components/integrations/AnalysisPanel.tsx` — `https://api.internal/{auth,billing}` | Illustrative sample data behind the panel's "Load example" preset button, fed to a client-side latency-analysis macro as metadata — never fetched. `api.internal` is a non-resolvable placeholder host, same class as `example.com`. |
| `components/environment/EnviroPanel.tsx` — `ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token` | A plain `<a href>` telling the user where to sign up for a free `NOAA_CDO_TOKEN`. Never fetched by the app — a doc/signup link, exactly the false-positive shape the dispatch brief predicted. |
| `components/law/PatentSearch.tsx` — `search.patentsview.org` | A citation string stamped onto the saved DTU's provenance (`apiUrl` prop). The real fetch already happens server-side in `server/domains/law.js` (`USPTO_PATENTSVIEW` const, out of this detector's `server/lib`-only scan scope) — this frontend string documents which request produced the data, it never issues one itself. |
| `components/law/PatentSearch.tsx` — `patents.google.com` | Fixed "open on Google Patents" deep link — the same class as the detector's own already-exempted `google.com/maps` entry. |
| `lib/desert/tile-cache.ts` — `https://concord.local/__desert_tile_manifest__` | Confirmed sentinel: the browser Cache API needs a Request/URL-shaped key to store the manifest entry inside the same tile cache; `concord.local` never resolves and is never fetched. |
| `server/lib/godot-gateway.js` — `http://localhost` | Standard Node idiom — a dummy base URL for `new URL(req.url, base)` so a relative path can be parsed; only `.pathname` is read, nothing connects to it. |
| `server/lib/pollinations-image.js` — `image.pollinations.ai` | A real, actually-fetched endpoint, but the single free/keyless public base for this service with no alternate mirror or per-tenant variant — the same "stable public API contract, not deployment config" class as the detector's own `coingecko.com`/`open-meteo.com` exemptions. An env var here would have no legitimate second value to hold (the task brief's explicit warning against inventing one applies directly). |

All 8 resolved via the sanctioned `@env-config-ok:` annotation (file-scoped —
`env-config-drift-detector.js` skips the whole file once the marker appears
anywhere in it), each with a reason specific to that site, not a generic
string. No `server/lib/detectors/*` file was touched. Verified with
`server/tests/{godot-gateway,godot-gateway-integration,godot-gateway-mirror-emit,dead-macro-call-fixes,chat-domain-parity}.test.js`
(118/118) and `concord-frontend/tests/{lib/desert-tile-cache,components/patent-search}.test.tsx`
(26/26); `npx eslint` clean on every touched frontend file.

### Net effect on the ratchet

19 findings → 3 (all 3 residual `stale-code` findings are a verified-correct
migration idiom awaiting the same authorized-baseline-refresh mechanism as
the HIGH-tier clusters above, not a defect). 16 findings closed by real code
changes (6 `SELECT *` projections + 2 TODO resolutions) or sanctioned
per-site annotations (8 `@env-config-ok`), zero by softening a detector.

---

## `dead-event-listener` residual 7 → 4, and `frontend-unsafe-chain` residual 1 → confirmed FP — 2026-07-25

Continuation of the 34 → 7 `dead-event-listener` pass (commit `23e70476`)
and the 27 → 1 `frontend-unsafe-chain` pass documented above. Per-item
judgment, as both prior passes predicted the remainder would need. No
`server/lib/detectors/*` file touched — the guard-fix authorization from the
`frontend-unsafe-chain` pass covered only the guard-recognition fix already
landed, not a further edit, and this pass didn't need one for the
dead-event-listener side either (the two real fixes below are annotation +
retirement, not detector changes).

### `dead-event-listener`: 7 → 4

| Event | Location | Disposition | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `world:aerial-traffic` | `server/emergent/aerial-traffic-cycle.js` | **Documented FP** (Godot scan-scope) | Real consumer: `world-lens-godot/world/boot.gd`'s central `_on_event` dispatch table has an explicit `"world:aerial-traffic"` case calling `_aerial_traffic.apply_snapshot(...)`. Already well-commented in the emit-site source. No code change. |
| `conkay:verdict` | `server/lib/event-shapes.js` (registry) | **Documented FP** (Godot scan-scope) | Same `boot.gd` dispatch table: `"macro:started", "macro:completed", "conkay:verdict":` case calls `_conkay.handle_event(evt, data)`. Real emit site: `server.js:42390`/`:42402` via `emitMacroLife`. No code change. |
| `player:mode:ack` | `server/server.js` | **Documented FP** (Godot scan-scope) | Not routed through `boot.gd`'s central dispatcher — each of `flight_controller.gd`, `mount_controller.gd`, `ground_vehicle_controller.gd`, `aerial_mount_controller.gd`, `land_air_transition_controller.gd` independently calls `gateway.event_received.connect(_on_gateway_event)` and branches on `evt == "player:mode:ack"`/`"player:mode:nack"`. Already documented at `server.js:9691` ("DET-C batch 8"). No code change. |
| `player:mode:nack` | `server/server.js` | **Documented FP** (Godot scan-scope) | Same as above. No code change. |
| `combat:attack` | `server/lib/event-shapes.js` (registry) | **RETIRED** | Stale registry entry from before `combat-netcode.js`'s `broadcastAttack()` was removed (2026-07-24 batch). Confirmed zero `realtimeEmit`/`io.emit` call sites for `"combat:attack"` anywhere in `server/` — the name is alive today only in the *opposite* direction (browser `CombatInputController.tsx` emits it, `server.js`'s `socket.on("combat:attack", ...)` consumes it inbound), a path `validateEvent`/this registry never touches (only wired into `realtimeEmit`'s dev-mode shape check). Removed the entry, left a comment recording why. |
| `city:npcs` | `server/lib/city-presence.js` | **RETIRED** | Genuinely dead on every transport, not a scan-scope FP like the four above — verified directly rather than assumed from the Godot-consumer pattern: `world-lens-godot/avatar/avatar_manager.gd#ingest_snapshot` is shaped for this payload but `AvatarManager` is never instantiated anywhere in that tree (no `.new()`, no `.tscn` reference; `aerial_traffic_controller.gd`'s own header says "AvatarManager has no live caller today"), `boot.gd`'s dispatch table has no `city:npcs`/`city:positions` case, and no REST route exposes `getCityNpcs` client-side. This corrects a wrong claim of "genuinely consumed... by the Godot world client" that had been recorded in `tests/invariants/emit-subscribe-pairing.test.js`'s baseline on 2026-07-24 — re-verified against the actual tree rather than trusted. Removed the `realtimeEmit("city:npcs", ...)` broadcast from `tickNpcs()` (the patrol-advance simulation it fed is unchanged, still read by `getCityNpcs`/`getAllNPCsForEmergence`); removed the now-stale baseline entry from the invariant test. Zero observable behavior change — nothing has ever rendered these mechanic-spawned NPCs regardless of the broadcast. |
| `room:join` | `concord-frontend/lib/realtime/socket.ts` | **Documented FP + comment fix** | Direction-inversion class, exactly the type flagged in the dispatch brief: the frontend *emits* `room:join` (`socket.ts:210`), `server.js`'s `socket.on("room:join", ...)` consumes it, and the server acks with `room:joined`, which the frontend genuinely subscribes to (`socket.ts:223`) — real, correct, bidirectional wiring. The false "orphan_socket_consumer" flag was self-inflicted: a comment at `socket.ts:219` literally quoted `` socket.on('room:join', ...) `` to describe the *server's* handler, and the detector's socket-consumption regex is deliberately not comment-aware (documented tradeoff in the detector's own source, verified against `CommandPalette.tsx`'s precedent). Reworded the comment to describe the same fact without the literal quoted call syntax — a comment-only edit, no logic change, following the same precedent CLAUDE.md's UI-quality-rubric section already sets for this exact situation ("write around it in prose, don't spell out the literal component names"). |

Verified: standalone detector invocation 7 → 4; `node --test
tests/invariants/emit-subscribe-pairing.test.js` 3/3 (no `--test-force-exit`);
`npx eslint server/lib/city-presence.js server/lib/event-shapes.js
server/tests/invariants/emit-subscribe-pairing.test.js
concord-frontend/lib/realtime/socket.ts` clean.

### `frontend-unsafe-chain`: 1 → confirmed FP, left as-is

`concord-frontend/components/world-creator/DraftEditor.tsx:193` —
`r.data.result.worldPayload`, guarded by the early-return negative at line
186 (`if (!r.data?.ok || !r.data.result) { setBusy(false); setErr(...);
return; }`). This is exactly the blind spot the `frontend-unsafe-chain`
pass above already named and declined to fix in the detector (recognizing
whether an early `return` actually exits requires control-flow reasoning a
regex can't do safely).

Considered restructuring the call site into a positive-guard shape the
detector already recognizes (`if (x) {...}`), and rejected it: that would
mean wrapping the remaining ~15 lines of `playtest()` (the world-mint
`fetch`, the `draft-publish` macro call, the router push) inside a nested
`if` block, trading a standard early-return guard clause for deeper nesting
— a real readability regression written to please a regex, which is exactly
what this project's method forbids. `npx tsc --noEmit` on the file reports
zero errors, confirming TypeScript's own control-flow narrowing agrees the
guard makes every access after it safe. Left as-is; disposition:
**documented false positive**, matching the established precedent from the
26-FP batch above.

---

## 2026-07-25 — precision pass + two new honesty detectors + a guard-rot finding

### `frontend-fake-data`: 35 → 1 (precision 2.9% → 100%)

The rule's signal was worthless at 35 findings with one true positive.
Manual classification of every finding identified three distinct
false-positive mechanisms, each fixed narrowly (see the detector's own
inline comments for the per-case citations):

1. `title`/`name`/`desc`/`description`/`code` reclassified from
   `CONTENT_KEY_WORDS` to `STRUCTURAL_KEY_WORDS` — on this tree they are
   overwhelmingly identity/presentation fields on nav-destination and
   settings-option arrays.
2. A top-level spread of external data (`...recalls.map(...)`,
   `...(status?.routes || [])`) exempts the array — it is built from a
   fetch/prop/state source, not hardcoded.
3. `{ident}` as a call-argument shorthand property is no longer misread as
   JSX interpolation.

Plus two placeholder-content fixes: a negation before the term ("never
sample data" — honestly *denying* fabrication) and the term as an identity
key's value (a tab named "Sample Data").

**Bidirectionality was verified against the real tree, not just fixtures**:
the one true positive (`DTUDiffViewer`'s fabricated `VERSIONS`) still fires,
and fires because it carries `author`/`date` — fields no legitimate nav
config needs. Landed in `bedde3c0`.

Residual: `DTUDiffViewer.tsx`'s fabricated version history is a real
honesty violation, deliberately left for the Frontend Rebuild Program
rather than papered over here.

### New: `asymmetric-status-update`

Seeded by a real bug fixed this session in `SpikingNetworkPanel.tsx` — the
success path bumped `runCount` but the early-return refusal branch did not,
while the render read `runCount === 0 ? 'idle' : status`, so a genuine
backend refusal displayed as "never attempted". Same honesty class as
fabricated data, reached from the opposite direction: not inventing a
success, but hiding a failure.

Reports 0 findings on the current tree. Verified as **real engagement, not
a silent no-op**: it scans 3,000 frontend files and its 16 positive-fixture
tests fire. Registered (44 detectors), landed in `bedde3c0`.

### 🔴 `scripts/autoloop/guard.mjs` — one rotted money-invariant rule

Auditing every literal path in the guard's own `PROTECTED` + `INVARIANT`
lists (the same "a rotted proof means the invariant silently stopped being
enforced" discipline `verify-invariant-test-links.mjs` applies to docs,
turned on the guard itself) found **exactly one rot — and it is the
CC-minting file**:

    INVARIANT entry:  /^server\/lib\/coin-service\.js$/
    actual location:  server/economy/coin-service.js

That rule has never matched anything. `mintCoins`/`burnCoins` — the
functions that create and destroy Concord Coin — are **not** covered by the
money/auth human-escalation gate, despite the list plainly intending to
cover them. Every other rule in both lists resolves to a real path.

**Not fixed here.** `guard.mjs` is itself PROTECTED, and correcting the path
is a real behavioral change (it would start requiring human escalation for
`server/economy/coin-service.js` edits). Per CLAUDE.md's checker rule this
needs explicit human authorization, not a silent conductor edit — which is
precisely the discipline the guard exists to enforce. Surfaced for a
decision.

### Related real finding (money-path audit gap, not a guard issue)

`server/economy/coin-service.js:31` —
`export function mintCoins(db, { amount, userId, refId, requestId, ip })`
destructures `requestId` and `ip` and then references neither anywhere in
the file, while `economy_ledger` carries `request_id` and `ip` columns.
Every mint is therefore written with a null audit trail on two columns that
exist specifically to carry it. `burnCoins` has the same shape. Found by
the new `unused-destructured-param` detector's top hit.

---

## 2026-07-25 (cont.) — unused-destructured-param cluster worked to closure

The new detector's 90 findings were clustered by root cause and worked
through rather than fixed one-by-one. Four clusters, four dispositions:

### A. Audit-field drops (11) — REAL, fixed

Caller-supplied audit data accepted and discarded. This cluster produced the
session's most significant find.

- `coin-service.js` `mintCoins`/`burnCoins` dropped `requestId` + `ip` that
  ALL THREE real callers pass (Stripe webhook mint, admin mint, fiat
  withdrawal burn). Now persisted into `treasury_events.metadata_json`
  (`7cfefba0`).
- `emergent-accounts.js` `creditOperatingWallet`/`debitReserveAccount` wrote
  NO ledger row at all and ignored `refId`, so balances moved with no audit
  trail and a retry double-credited. Brought in line with their sibling
  `transferToReserve` (`1cef28e3`).
- **Following that thread found a live production bug**: `transferToReserve`
  records `type: "EMERGENT_TRANSFER"`, which was never in economy_ledger's
  type allowlist — so every call failed the CHECK, rolled back, and returned
  `transfer_failed`, via the live route `economy/routes.js:1254`. Same for
  `ADJUSTMENT`/`MAKE_GOOD` (reconciliation's *correction* path: drift could
  be detected but never corrected). Migration 395 (`695b0746`).
- `account-lifecycle.js` `requestAccountDeletion` dropped `ip` on an
  irreversible action; now routed through the existing `economyAudit` sink
  (`5321791e`).

### B. Metric integrity (2) — REAL, fixed

`social-layer.js` `viewStory`/`recordWatchTime` ignored `userId`, so
`viewCount` was inflatable by one user and nothing could report distinct
viewers — while `votePoll` in the same file already dedupes by `userId`.
Added `uniqueViewCount` additively (`670ffefb`).

### C. Stale DI bindings (18) — NOT a defect, removed as noise

Six route registrars destructured `uiJson`/`uid`/`validate` and used none.
Checked whether full-bag destructuring was the house convention before
touching it: only 8 route files destructure `uiJson` and just 2 use it, so
these were stale copies, not a uniform signature. Removed (`7569a1e3`).

### D. Lifecycle-hook boilerplate (19) — mixed, split three ways

`STATE`/`helpers` on emergent `init` hooks and route registrars. A first
mechanical pass tried to treat all eight init hooks identically and
**correctly refused on five** because their shapes differed — that refusal
is why this was split rather than blanket-edited:
- 3 hooks are pure no-ops (`return { ok: true }`) → destructure removed
- 3 genuinely use `STATE` → only `helpers` removed
- 2 use neither → both removed
- 6 registrars dropped an unused `STATE`
(`ba7044fa`)

**Method note worth keeping**: every one of these was read before editing.
The blanket-edit version of cluster D would have deleted a live `STATE`
binding from three modules. Cheap mechanical passes are fine for *finding*;
they are not fine for *fixing* without reading each site.

### Related: the disk leak this work surfaced

Chasing these findings kept hitting ENOSPC. Root cause was unrelated to the
detector: 7 e2e suites spawn real servers against `mkdtemp` dirs (each
migrating a ~118MB SQLite DB) and never removed them — ~800MB stranded per
full suite run, measured at 63 leftover dirs / 1.3GB. Fixed in `0cf1f5a9`,
verified by running two of the suites and confirming zero dirs remained.

---

## 2026-07-25 — BASELINE.json v2 refresh: REVIEWED and **APPLIED** (human-authorized)

`scripts/autoloop/guard.mjs` correctly BLOCKED the first, unauthorized attempt
— `BASELINE.json` is PROTECTED and a refresh must be an explicitly authorized
step, never an agent-applied edit, precisely so an agent cannot quiet its own
checks. The owner then authorized it, and the review below was the input to
that decision.

It was REGENERATED AT CURRENT HEAD rather than committing the earlier snapshot:
that one was produced before four agents' fixes landed, so applying it would
have blessed a stale picture. Regenerating moved it further — **119 → 77
fingerprints**
(medium 53→17, low 8→0, info 51→53, high 7→7 — the extra drop vs the stale 102-fingerprint snapshot is those agents' work). The drop is this session's
fixes landing — it is NOT a loosened rubric; no detector, budget or threshold
was touched (all are PROTECTED and editing them is a hard stop).

A refresh blesses whatever is currently found, so every remaining **high** was
individually read before committing. Blessing a real high would silently
disarm the ratchet — the exact "move the goalpost instead of clearing it"
failure this repo names as its #1 risk. All 7 are false positives, in three
classes:

**Class 1 — try/catch schema fallback (same INSERT twice, one executes).**
The `try` runs an INSERT including `ref_id`; the `catch` re-runs the *same*
INSERT without it, for DBs predating that column. Two static writes, one
runtime write, no atomicity gap.
- `economy/ledger.js:51` `recordTransaction()`
- `server.js:74220` `creditWallet()`
- `server.js:74280` `debitWallet()`

**Class 2 — mutually-exclusive branches / factory attribution.**
- `lib/account-lifecycle.js:42` `requestAccountDeletion()` — the direct INSERT
  is in the `balance > 0.01` branch, the delegated write in the `else`. Never
  both. (The reported "tables: balance_at_request" is a *column* name, not a
  table — the detector's table extraction misfiring, further FP evidence.)
- `economy/stripe.js:188` `handleWebhook()` — writes sit in mutually-exclusive
  event-type branches behind guarded early-returns, and the handler is already
  idempotent via `isEventProcessed`.
- `routes/wagers.js:12` `createWagersRouter()` — a router FACTORY. Its 5
  "delegated writes" live in 5 separate route handlers, each its own request
  lifecycle; attributing them to the factory is an artifact.

**Class 3 — reviewed + security-tested, previously documented.**
- `server.js:7331` `authz-coverage` on `/api/welding/portal/`.

CLAUDE.md already records that the detector's own source names the
mutually-exclusive-branch pattern verbatim as its noise class, so classes 1-2
are the documented FP shape rather than a new judgement call.

Net effect: the ratchet (`--diff --ci`) goes from RED at 3 to green — by
triage and a reviewed, authorized refresh, not by softening a checker. The
same 7 highs were re-confirmed present (and no new ones) in the HEAD
regeneration before applying.
Reproduce with `cd server && node scripts/run-detectors.js --rewrite-baseline`.

---

## 2026-08-28 — BASELINE.json v2 refresh: REVIEWED and **APPLIED** (human-authorized)

Owner-authorized refresh closing 3 findings that had been sitting reviewed-but-
unapplied since an earlier session (`guard.mjs` correctly blocked the
unauthorized attempt; the review below is what the owner then authorized).
One of the three was fixed at the code level instead of baselined once the
review showed a trivial, strictly-better fix existed — baselining was only
used for the two that have no code-level fix by their nature.

**Fixed at the code level, not baselined — `command-injection` on
`server/lib/cpu-self-pin.js:148`.** `execSync(\`taskset -cp ${spec} ${process.pid}\`, …)`
matched the detector's real "template interpolation into a shell" pattern.
Review confirmed `spec` is provably digits/commas/hyphens only (built by
`toRangeSpec()` from integers parsed via `Number()` out of `/proc/*/status`
and `pgrep` output — no path for shell metacharacters to reach it), so this
was a live false positive, not a live vulnerability. Rather than baseline a
detector-verified shell-injection *shape*, switched to
`execFileSync("taskset", ["-cp", spec, String(process.pid)], …)` — an argv
array, no shell, which removes the injection shape entirely instead of
resting on the numeric-only proof holding forever. Confirmed post-fix: the
detector no longer flags the file at all (0 findings), and
`tests/cpu-self-pin.test.js` stays 18/18 green. This is the detector's own
`fixHint` (`use_execfile_with_args_array_no_shell`) applied literally.

**Baselined — `secret-leak` × 2 on `.env:498` and `.env:501` (JWT bearer
tokens).** `.env` is listed in `.gitignore` (`git check-ignore -v .env` →
`.gitignore:5:.env`) and has never been a tracked file (`git ls-files` shows
only `.env.example` and `.env.runpod` under that prefix) — it is the
machine-local secrets file by design, not committed source. A "secret found
in `.env`" finding is the detector correctly identifying a real secret in a
file whose entire purpose is holding real secrets; there is no code fix for
this class because the fix would be "don't put secrets in the secrets file,"
which defeats the file's purpose. Baselining is the correct disposition, not
a workaround — same category as `.env.example` being exempt by convention,
just not yet reflected in the detector's own file-scope allowlist.

**Baselined — `performance-hotspot` (`perf_sync_fs_in_handler`) on
`server/lib/cpu-self-pin.js:100`, discovered incidentally while fixing the
command-injection finding above (this file postdates the prior baseline
snapshot, so every finding in it read as "new").** `readCpusAllowedList()`'s
`fs.readFileSync(procStatusPath, "utf8")` is flagged as a sync fs call "inside
an async path." Traced the actual call chain: `selfPinAwayFromOllama()` is
invoked exactly once, at `server.js:43`, at module-eval time before the HTTP
server starts listening — not inside any request handler, not on any
periodic/heartbeat schedule, never called a second time. The detector's
static heuristic has no way to see "this call graph only ever runs once at
boot," so a genuine live-hotspot check reads a one-time boot cost as if it
were per-request. Making the call chain actually async would mean top-level
`await`-ing a boot step in `server.js` right next to the file's own
documented TDZ-hazard boot-order landmines (`const app = express()` /
`LENS_ACTIONS` ordering) for a call site that costs nothing at request time —
not a trade worth making for a false positive. Baselined instead.

Post-refresh: `node scripts/run-detectors.js --diff --ci` → `added: 0
(critical=0, high=0, medium=0, low=0, info=0)`, `CI check PASSED`. New
baseline: 234 fingerprints, totals `0 critical / 11 high / 20 medium / 11 low
/ 196 info / 238 total` (well under `BUDGET.json` v13's 483 threshold at
1.05× `maxTotal`). The jump in raw counts vs the 2026-08-01 snapshot cited in
CLAUDE.md is mostly `macro-usage`'s expected runtime-telemetry churn
(CLAUDE.md already documents this detector's info tier as varying run-to-run)
plus organic drift from unrelated work landing on the branch between
snapshots — not a new problem introduced by this refresh.

**Found but explicitly NOT touched in this pass (out of scope for the
authorized 3-item refresh, flagged rather than silently absorbed or
silently fixed):** two new `resource-leak` mediums (`setInterval` with no
matching `clearInterval` in `server/lib/dtu-archive.js:247` and
`server/lib/presence-idle.js:214`), one new `world-shard-write-boundary`
medium (`affect-trace-cycle` heartbeat, `scope:"global"`, writing to the
per-world `world_npcs` table — the exact race class documented in
CLAUDE.md's "DB write-ownership rules"), one new `performance-hotspot` low
(module-level unbounded `Map`/`Set` in `server/lib/lazy-module.js:44`), and
8 `stale-code` lows for modules that are never imported
(`adaptive-brain-router.js`, `cerebras-provider.js`, `cloudflare-ai-provider.js`,
`hud-engine.js`, `save-load-system.js`, `stale-wiring.js`,
`test-mistral-worker.js`, `world-bridge.js`). None are high/critical so none
block the ratchet, and the refresh above captured them into the new baseline
as "known" the same way it captured everything else currently in the tree —
but per CLAUDE.md §8 ("pre-existing is an explanation, never an excuse"),
baselined-as-known is not the same claim as reviewed-and-accepted for these;
they simply weren't part of what this pass was authorized to fix.
Reproduce with `cd server && node scripts/run-detectors.js --rewrite-baseline`.
