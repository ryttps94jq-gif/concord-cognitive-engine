# Security Policy — ConcordOS v1

ConcordOS v1 is designed to be **local-first**. Your DTUs and system state live on your machine by default. Optional LLM use is **opt-in** and requires a user-supplied API key.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |

## Threat Model (What Concord v1 Protects Against)

Concord v1 aims to reduce common risks for a local-first tool:

- ✅ Accidental data exposure to cloud services (default: no cloud)
- ✅ Unintentional API key commits (recommended: `.env` ignored + `.env.example` committed)
- ✅ Unsafe “global publishing” of unverified content (governed by policy)
- ✅ Basic cross-origin misuse (CORS scoped for local dev)

Concord does **not** claim to protect against:

- ❌ A fully compromised machine (malware/root access)
- ❌ Malicious browser extensions reading local content
- ❌ A user intentionally pasting secrets into prompts/DTUs
- ❌ Supply-chain attacks from dependencies you install

## Data Handling

### Local Storage
Concord v1 stores DTUs and related state locally (example files may include):

- `server/memory.json`
- any local SQLite/JSON storage used by your build

**You control the files.** If you delete them, the data is gone.

### Optional LLM Mode
If you enable LLM features:

- Requests may be sent to your selected LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI)
- The content you submit is the content that leaves your device
- Concord does not auto-upload your full DTU library unless you explicitly trigger an LLM call that includes it

**Rule of thumb:** Don’t paste secrets into prompts or DTUs you plan to send to an LLM.
