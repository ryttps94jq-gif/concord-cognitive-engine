# 🜂 Concord Cognitive Engine

### AI that shows its receipts.

**Proves what it claims. Refuses what it can't. Remembers everything — and pays you when your work gets built on.**

</div>

---

## See it running — no signup, no waiting

![Concord landing](docs/images/01-landing.png)

Most platforms ask you to trust the pitch first and see the product later. Don't. Walk in yourself, right now, with no account:

**[→ concord-os.org/explore](https://concord-os.org/explore)** — a live public entry point, forked into whichever half you're actually here for:

- **[The knowledge engine](https://concord-os.org/explore/engine)** — DTUs, a citation economy that pays you, real deterministic compute (a symbolic CAS, structural FEA, orbital mechanics) instead of an LLM guessing the answer.
- **[The living world](https://concord-os.org/explore/world)** — Concordia, hundreds of NPCs running their own factions, schemes, and wars, with real Skyrim-style combat. Mature content, 18+.

Or skip the tour and just [**watch the world live**](https://concord-os.org/spectate/concordia-hub) — a read-only feed of what's happening right now, updating in real time, no account, no download. Nothing here is staged for a demo. It's the same substrate real users are on.

---

Most AI tools **generate**. Concord generates **and verifies, attributes, and remembers** — then audits and repairs *itself*. One knowledge substrate (the **DTU**), expressed through 266 domain "lenses," welded to a creator economy, a 3D civilization simulator, and a mesh network that works without the internet.

| | |
|---|---|
| 🧠 **A second brain that compounds** | Knowledge you own, cited, and growing into a living substrate — get paid when someone else builds on it. |
| 🌍 **A world that runs without you** | Hundreds of NPCs living their own lives, forming factions, waging wars, whether you're watching or not. |
| 🔬 **Real math, not a guess** | A symbolic CAS, direct-stiffness FEA, orbital mechanics, double-entry accounting — it computes the answer instead of hallucinating it. |
| 🔍 **It audits itself** | 51 detectors, a drift monitor, and a repair cortex that proposes its own fixes but can't apply them unsupervised. |

In a market where the bottleneck has shifted from *generating* to *trusting*, **verification is the product.**

## Why it's different — the white space

Every incumbent owns exactly **one** vector. None ship the intersection. *(full argument: [`docs/WHY_CONCORD_IS_DIFFERENT.md`](docs/WHY_CONCORD_IS_DIFFERENT.md))*

| Vector | Who owns it | Concord |
|---|---|---|
| Grounded / verified | Perplexity, Wolfram | ✅ `reason.verify` + citation floors + drift monitor |
| General capability | ChatGPT | ✅ 5-brain router + ~10,399 macros |
| Private / local | Ollama | ✅ local brains + consent gates + no-leak invariant |
| Controllable memory | Notion | ✅ DTU substrate + scope/consent gates |
| Owned / no-subscription | *(unowned)* | ✅ free + local + 95%-to-creator economy |

The closest one-liner: **Wolfram × Roblox, built by one person** — a verified-compute knowledge engine fused with a creator-economy world platform, plus a self-auditing layer neither has.

## The architecture, from altitude

Concord is best read as **concentric rings** — inner rings are the substrate, outer rings are Concord acting on itself and the world.

## The moat is the *couplings*

The 326 novelties matter less than how they're wired to each other. Anyone can copy a primitive; copying the web is the years-long part.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    DRIFT["corpus contradiction<br/>(drift monitor)"] -->|spawns| QUEST["playable quest /<br/>haunted game-zone"]
    PAIN["combat damage"] -->|somatic ledger| XP["skill XP"] -->|grants| BUFF["resist buff"]

    ACT["what you actually did"] -->|stitched, never invented| DREAM["offline dream"]
    BUG["a bug"] -->|AI-generated VERIFIED fix| GATE["governance proposal<br/>(never auto-applied)"]
```

The knowledge graph, the economy, the game, and the codebase's own self-repair are **the same fabric.** No incumbent has that.

---

## The rarest property: self-aware by construction

Concord carries a **running model of itself** and acts on it — the part that's genuinely hard to find anywhere:

- **Cartographer** auto-maps its own anatomy (765 tables, 140 heartbeats, ~10,399 macros) every pass.
- **51 detectors + a baseline-ratchet** audit its own honesty — CI fails on any new high/critical. *(It's why this repo's docs are falsifiable.)*
- **Drift monitor** watches the corpus for 6 ways the system can lie to itself.
- **Repair cortex** proposes its own surgery but **can't perform it unsupervised** — every code fix routes through a governance gate.

A system engineered to **distrust itself** is the right architecture for the one thing the AI market actually lacks.

## Under-appreciated strengths

**Real deterministic compute — not LLM-guessed.** A symbolic CAS, direct-stiffness **FEA**, a gate-based **quantum statevector simulator**, stoichiometry, orbital mechanics, **causal-closure analysis**, NEC electrical code, aircraft weight & balance, k-anonymity, double-entry accounting, an epidemiology sim. *(Inventory groups O · U · AH.)* This is the R&D wedge: an agent that **computes the answer instead of hallucinating it.**

**Real connectors.** All six marquee connectors are code-complete: Gmail + Google Calendar are real two-way (send/push + read/inbox/pull); Slack, Sheets, GitHub, and Notion are built and contract-tested on the same SSRF-guarded chokepoint with encrypted per-user tokens. Going live on any of them needs only operator-supplied OAuth client credentials.

A lens — Finance (left), Code (right). Each lens reads as the app it replaces (a
trading dashboard, a VS Code shell) while sharing one substrate, one macro spine,
one economy:

## Maturity — honest

**Deployed and live at [concord-os.org](https://concord-os.org) — deployment is proven and repeatable.** This backlog is built and shipped through that deploy path, and real users' requests drive the work. A dedicated audit pass went looking specifically for concurrent-load, high-volume-traffic, and money-at-volume failure modes and fixed real instances of each (a connection-dropping root cause, LLM-pipeline truncation, a critical wallet-drain IDOR, an authenticated RCE, and more) rather than leaving them theoretical, and a real admission-control layer sheds excess load under measured event-loop lag instead of degrading uncontrolled — but no literal heavy-load run has been executed against the live deployment, so "proven under real traffic" remains future work, not a claim made here. A handful of systems (the Foundation signal-layer, some emergent-civilization systems) are research-grade — built, wired, and running today, just not yet validated against real-world physical conditions specifically. Depth isn't papered over with generic scaffolding either: a dedicated detector mechanically checks every lens for auto-generated-template patterns, and the current count is 0/265. *(Full caveats: [`docs/WHY_CONCORD_IS_DIFFERENT.md`](docs/WHY_CONCORD_IS_DIFFERENT.md) · [`docs/STATE_OF_CONCORD.md`](docs/STATE_OF_CONCORD.md).)*

## Quickstart

```bash
# Backend
cd server && npm install && npm run migrate && npm start      # :5050
# Frontend
cd concord-frontend && npm install && npm run dev             # :3000
# Full stack (backend + frontend + 5 Ollama brains + nginx/redis/qdrant/prometheus)
docker-compose up
```
Requires `JWT_SECRET` in production. Five Ollama instances default to models originally sized for an RTX PRO 4500 Blackwell; the real deployed target is a single NVIDIA A40 (48GB), with per-deployment overrides tuned for that box (override any model via env). See [`docs/CONNECTORS_GO_LIVE.md`](docs/CONNECTORS_GO_LIVE.md) for connector setup.

Running the frontend standalone (`npm run dev`, not `docker-compose up`)? Copy
`concord-frontend/.env.example` to `concord-frontend/.env.local` first — an
unconfigured `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` is the #1 cause of
a persistent "Connection lost" banner in dev (the frontend defaults to the
backend's `:5050` dev port automatically now if you skip this, but a real
`.env.local` pointed at your actual backend host is still the correct setup
for anything other than same-box localhost).

**Realtime requires the nginx layer in front of the frontend container.**
`docker-compose up`'s `nginx` service proxies `/socket.io/` directly to the
backend with correct WebSocket `Upgrade` headers (`nginx/conf.d/
default.conf`); Next.js's own `output: 'standalone'` server does not forward
WS upgrade headers through its `rewrites()`, so any deploy path that hits the
frontend container directly — bypassing nginx — will silently break socket
reconnection. Always route through nginx (or an equivalent WS-aware proxy) in
production.

## Repo map

| Path | What's there |
|---|---|
| `server/server.js` | One file by deliberate choice (IP protection), not organic sprawl — every route is independently dispatched (no single blocking call path), background simulation runs on a strictly-sequential, per-module-isolated tick (one handler at a time, a crash or timeout in one never stops the next), and a real front-door admission-control layer (`lib/request-admission.js`) sheds load under measured event-loop lag rather than degrading uncontrolled |
| `server/domains/` | 420 domain engines (the lens backends) |
| `server/emergent/` | 231 simulation modules (the living layer) |
| `server/lib/` | 690+ subsystem libs (brains, DTUs, embodied, repair cortex, detectors) |
| `server/migrations/` | 398 numbered migrations (765 tables) |
